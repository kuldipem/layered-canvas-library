= Canvas.LayerManager =

LayerManager is a singleton class that manages Layers as well as Items within lay within the Layers. You access it simply by invoking it's name, and methods. Canvas.LayerManager.findLayer("layerID"); for example.

= Properties =

_Private_ *Array Layers* An array that contains the Layers that the LayerManager manages.

= Methods =

_Private_ *draw(DOMCanvasContext ctx)* This method fires the draw function of each Layer it manages, which in turn fires the draw method on each Item, the Layers contain.

_Private_ *findLayer(String layerID)* Finds a Layer by the string identifier layerID, then returns it.

_Private_ *findItem(String itemID, String layerID `[optional]`)* Finds an Item by the string identifier itemID, and returns it.

_Private_ *findLayerPosition(String layerID)* Finds a Layer by the string identifier layerID, then returns it's position.

_Private_ *getLayerAt(Integer position)* Finds a Layer by at it's position and returns it.

_Private_ *addLayer(Object layer, Bool isLayer `[optional]`)* Adds a Layer to to the LayerManager. The layer parameter can be a complex object that is a Layer template, or a constructed Layer. If it is a constructed Layer isLayer must be set to true.

_Private_ *promoteLayer(String layerID)* Finds a Layer by the string identifier layerID, then adjusts it's order so that it is drawn after other Layers. Here is an example;

layers : [layera, layerb, layerc];

promote(layera);

layers : [layerb, layera, layerc];

_Private_ *demoteLayer(String layerID)* Finds a Layer by the string identifier layerID, then adjusts it's order so that it is drawn before other Layers. See promoteLayer as an example... except reverse.

_Private_ *moveLayerTo(String layerID, Integer position)* Finds a Layer by the string identifier layerID, then moves it to the specified position.

_Private_ *removeLayer(String layerID)* Finds a Layer by the string identifier layerID, and removes it. Note: this will also remove the Layers Items.

_Private_ *toString()* Returns a list of all the Layers the LayerManager is managing.
