Thank you for your interest in the layered canvas library. Unfortunately I have not had time to continue to develop this project, along with my other interests. So I am no longer actively developing this project.

The Layered Canvas Library (LCL) is a javascript library that helps manage objects on the Canvas element. The LCL implements a two tier layer manager that creates and contains items within it. The layer manager attaches mouse events to each item contained, and allows the user to define handlers for each event, per item. The layer manager also allows for each layer contained to be promoted, or demoted over another layer. The layer manager, and each layer, and item contained, is defined with a draw function. The draw function executes user defined code to draw the item, layer, or each layer contained consecutively.

For examples, view any of the wiki pages, or there are demos available in the full version download.
